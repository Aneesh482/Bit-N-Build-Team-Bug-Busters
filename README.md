#The Future of Retail Sprint
---
Problem Statement:
The brick-and-mortar retail experience is struggling to compete with the convenience of
e-commerce. How might we use emerging technologies like Augmented Reality (AR), Computer
Vision, and AI to create a seamless, personalized, and engaging "phygital" (physical + digital)
shopping experience that gives people a reason to love visiting stores again? Create a prototype
that enhances the in-store journey, from discovery to checkout.
