This project is the submission for the buildnBuild Hackathon by Team Bug Busters.

Hackathon Problem Statements
1. The Digital Public Square Challenge
Problem Statement:
In an era of information overload and fragmented digital communities, how might we re-imagine the
concept of a "town square" for the digital age? Participants are challenged to design and prototype a
platform or tool that fosters constructive, inclusive, and engaging public discourse online. The
solution should aim to bridge societal divides, combat misinformation, and encourage empathetic
communication between people of diverse backgrounds and viewpoints.

2. The Climate Resilience Hack
Problem Statement:
Climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, from floods
and wildfires to heatwaves. Local communities, especially vulnerable and underserved populations,
are often the hardest hit and slowest to recover. How might we leverage technology to build
community resilience before, during, and after a climate-related disaster? Develop a solution that
helps individuals and communities prepare for, respond to, and recover from these events.

3. The Future of Retail Sprint
Problem Statement:
The brick-and-mortar retail experience is struggling to compete with the convenience of
e-commerce. How might we use emerging technologies like Augmented Reality (AR), Computer
Vision, and AI to create a seamless, personalized, and engaging "phygital" (physical + digital)
shopping experience that gives people a reason to love visiting stores again? Create a prototype
that enhances the in-store journey, from discovery to checkout.

4. The Inclusive Education App Challenge
Problem Statement:
Despite the rise of educational apps, specially-abled students often face significant barriers in
accessing learning content effectively. How might we design a mobile or web-based education
platform that provides an intuitive, inclusive, and adaptive learning experience for students with
physical, cognitive, or sensory disabilities? Participants should focus on creating UI/UX solutions
that ensure accessibility, engagement, and equitable learning opportunities for all.
